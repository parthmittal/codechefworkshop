First, read through \href{https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/venn-diagrams.html}{this page}.
After you are done reading, be sure to try the questions at the end.

You don't need to memorize any of the definitions, just try to understand them.
If you ever forget something, you can always go back and read it again.

Once you are done with the previous section, pat yourself on the back, and go out and play.

Then, move on and read \href{https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/sets-introduction.html}{this page}.
This one also has exercises at the end, so you should try them too.
Then you can have fun with \href{https://www.mathsisfun.com/activity/subsets.html}{the activity} at the end.

Once you are comfortable with all of the above, read
\href{https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/set-builder-notation.html}{this page}, but not all of it.
Stop just before the topic ``Defining a domain'', we need to study some other things before we read that.

And that's all, have fun with the rest of your day!
