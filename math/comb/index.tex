\title{Combinatorics}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This is a fancy new word, but actually combinatorics is just about counting.
Read lessons 1 thru 5 (both included) over
\href{http://www.coolmath.com/algebra/20-combinatorics}{here}.
There is a lot of new material here, so take your time, and don't try to do it
all in one sitting.

And that's it!
